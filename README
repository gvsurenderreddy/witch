   ~alpha notes ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Until witchcraft gets out of alpha, you may want to do this in a virtual machine running systemrescuecd or another gentoo-based live distro (or other distro even).

iso remastery has been removed for a complete re-write.
only the proper gentoo install section is written so far. (will go through a second refunctionising and revariablising to accomodate funtoo, exherbo etc with greater ease, later, once we suss the chroot issue, and get working installs out of it)
