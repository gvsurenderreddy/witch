%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
to test the witchcraft script's gentoo instalation:
first, you'll need to:
download the systemrescuecd
download & install virtualbox
    launch virtualbox
        create a new linux gentoo machine,
            give it as much ram as you think is healthy for your computer to handle virtualising,
            and a reasonably large virtual hd  (idk how small is safe)
        set virtualbox's cd drive to have the systemrescuecd's iso file in it
        start the new virtual machine
        wait for systemrescuecd to finish booting, then type startx, and hit enter.
            open midori, go get the witchcraft script. 
                https://raw.github.com/Digit/witch/master/witchcraft2012-1-0.sh
                    ^ probably the right branch, check with digit in #witchlinux
            copy n paste that into a file somewhere in "$PATH"
                (i.e. /bin/witchcraft is good)
            make it executable
                (chmod +x /bin/witchcraft)
            then run it
                (i.e just type witchcraft into the terminal and hit enter).
                follow the steps,
                heed the warnings,
                take great care to enter everything correctly.
                but feel safe, knowing this is just a virtual machine.
                to test the script portion that's being worked on:
                    first question: answer b
                    second question: answer b again
                    third question: answer 1
                    i'll let you figure out the rest from there.
                or feel free to explore other paths in the script, 
                    but be prepared for disapointment, and messages of incomplete

   ~alpha notes ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Until witchcraft gets out of alpha, you may want to do this in a virtual machine running systemrescuecd or another gentoo-based live distro (or other distro even).

iso remastery has been removed for a complete re-write.
only the proper gentoo install section is written so far. (will go through a second refunctionising and revariablising to accomodate funtoo, exherbo etc with greater ease, later, once we suss the chroot issue, and get working installs out of it)

soon. ''_''
