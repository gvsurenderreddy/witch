METADISTRO=FUNTOO
#section removed for re-functionising of the script.
#these base distro choices, will set variables which will control the shape of various options (/install sections) suited to that distro (e.g. differences of stuff included in the stage3s)
#this will be really cool simple additions in some places, like if metadistro = funtoo then diddle-de-dee ~ maybe.  not rly decided on which route to take with sorting out for the multi-distro bases.
