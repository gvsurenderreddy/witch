#+TITLE: EAGLE Augments Grml with Lisp and Emacs

* The Problem

  #+LABEL: arcane-parens

  #+CAPTION: Lisp is arcane and mystical.

  Make the most prominent Lisp flavors in 2013 (Emacs Lisp, Common
  Lisp, and Scheme) more approachable to new hackers, by
  bootstrapping them into an environment with sane defaults and fun
  goodies.  Make working Lisp environments that actually do stuff
  easily reproducible and not unique snowflakes.

* TODO Project Goals [0/4]

** TODO Lisp integration

*** TODO Bootstrap SBCL with [[http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]]

    - StumpWM

    - CLFSWM

    - SLIME

    - Some kind of IDEish thing (CLIM-listener?  CLIMACS?)

*** TODO Bootstrap Emacs with ELPA

    - Org-based init, perhaps based on [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit][Eric Schulte's Emacs Starter Kit]]

    - Cover the basics: Gnus, org+contrib, REPLy-goodness (SLIME, Geiser)

    - [[http://elnode.org/][Elnode]] on a USB?  Brilliant!

*** TODO Bootstrap Guile and [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][GNU GUIX]]

*** TODO MIT Lisp Machine Emulation

    Investigate [[http://www.unlambda.com/index.php?n%3DMain.Cadr][MIT CADR Emulator]] licensing/redistributability status

** TODO UI/UX stuff

*** TODO Welcome screen

    - Installs Lisp stuff from the list above on demand.

    - welcome.org: Literate Org program as a guide for the distro

      + People can contribute Lisp software installation/config
        recipes by adding to the Org file or files

    - Expand upon [[https://github.com/grml/grml-quickconfig][grml-quickconfig]]?

*** TODO Artwork

    - Desktop background: Nice options from Digit

    - Syslinux theme

** TODO Persistent live system

   - Like [[http://grml.org/][Grml]] itself, should be a live system by default, with a quick
     and easy installer.  Build on the tools already there.

   - Either make proper Debian packages for artwork and Lisp stuffs
     (better) or add it to the FAI chroot (kludgier).

** TODO Extra Flavors

   - "Warm start:" includes some pre-downloaded, pre-compiled bytecode
     for big programs (StumpWM already ready to go as default WM,
     etc.)

   - Defiant: Security/anonymity layer for EAGLE, features Tor
     TransProxy for main user and a tmpfs guest user
