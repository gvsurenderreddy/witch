#insert rewic here, once it's sorted out

# NOTE! this function in the script WAS (now removed) a franken-disection-hackage gutted from tazlitoforwitchcraftextractions, which is just a copy of the earliest tazlito to have write-iso included.  it still needs much re-reading n hackage to get to work, especially across all gentoo-esq (and other) distros.    ... so i just completely removed it for now.  i think it was 1.3... er... or 2.1  or..   sometime around there it got the writeiso feature.
#all tazlito changed to rewic, and all slitaz changed to witch.  ;)  just so you know.

###  let the hacking commence!
#removed... ...devomer#

#might wanna consider nabbing some ideas from debian-live-helper and the linux-live scripts famed from the slackers.  
#but tazlito's remasterer is rather the tits, so if we could get it to work instead, it'd be... " the tits "
echo "rewic, the iso remastery stuff has been gutted from this version while we work out the installer stuff ~ no loss it didnt work yet anyway." ;
