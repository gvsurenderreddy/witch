as is currently:  install, remove, update, upgrade and search commands are preliminarily coded for portage, paludis's cave, apt-get, slaptget, pacman, and zypper.  (please pop into #witchlinux on irc.freenode.net to suggest others to add, or other ideas, fixes, etc.)

### the original jotting down of early notion:
# rspm command : package manager used : command used
rspm install : apt-get : apt-get install
rspm update : apt-get : apt-get update

##^  i think i only scrawled that before going off n writing rspm.sh.  see rspm.sh for the real meat.  i've tried to keep the code as clear and just-enough as possible, though the idea below may require either a bit of muddying that clarity, and or a radical refactoring.   ... not to mention the issues surrounding the nuances of each package manager.

### the simplification/shortification rethink:

#install

rspm install packagename
rspm -i packagename
rspm packagename


#remove/uninstall

rspm remove packagename
rspm uninstall packagename #also echoes to use remove/-r
rspm -r packagename
rspmr packagename

#sync/update (to refresh available packages list)

rspm sync
rspm update
rspm -s
rspms 

#update/upgrade (ups installed software to newest)

rspm upgrade
rspm -u
rspmu

#sync & upgrade

rspmsu

#search/find

rspm search packagename
rspm find packagename
rspm -f packagename
rspmf packagename
