since there's no official site, resulting from the philosophy of no central hierarchy or dictator, we'll try to be helpfull enough to keep tabs on witch sites.
http://tinyurl.com/witchlinux - usually keeps reasonably up to date with witch links, has a webchat to the irc channel.
http://witch.fuge.it - has some stuff
http://invariability.com/witch - down
puffinux forums - down - see the forum section (accessible through the tinyurl link)
