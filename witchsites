witch sites
===========

since there iss no official site, resulting from the philosophy of no central hierarchy or dictator, we will try to be helpfull enough to keep tabs on witch sites.

[http://tinyurl.com/witchlinux](http://tinyurl.com/witchlinux) - usually keeps reasonably up to date with some witch links, has a webchat to the irc channel.
[http://witch.fuge.it] - has/had some stuff
[http://invariability.net/witch] - down
puffinux forums - down - see the forum section (accessible through the tinyurl link)
[digit\'s other site\'s witch directory](http://ks392457.kimsufi.com/stuff/distros/witch/ has some witch stuff
[digit\'s git](https://github.com/Digit/witch) is where Digit keeps his main witchcraft efforts and a jumble of other stuff.  gives write access to well-intentioned competent regulars / full-timers.
[digit\'s gitorious](http://gitorious.org/witch#more) has a nice intro.
[wei2912\'s github witch repo] - down -  disapeared shortly after being given write access to Digit\'s github
[jony123\'s github](https://github.com/jony123/witch) has a nice old snapshot of Digit\'s github
there are others too...

and again, to re-emphasise the point... 
=======================================

no one of these sites is **THE** witch site.  
any such site claiming to be such, is something completely different, and misses the point of witch.

make your own
=============

that\'s not a command unto you, there\'s no obligation.  just a happy encouragement.

you can make your own witch site, repo, whatever.  the point is the freedom to do so, without asking permission.

stick the word "witch" on it somewhere if you like, incase you feel like that's needed to give you license to make it.

not necessary though.  nor is it even necessary you tell us about it.  
we\'re not the bureau of witch, we\'re not the council, the H.Q., or any of that nonsense.

it is sad that we had become so dependent on authority to tell us when it is ok.
you are an adult (probably), not a child of the state, and even if you are a child of the state, or a real child, you can still go ahead and make any witch you like.
... and any site too.
